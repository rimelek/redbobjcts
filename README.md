# R.E. DBObjects

Just a hobby project, NOT FOR PRODUCTION! See [R.E. Login](https://github.com/rimelek/relogin/)
to understand why this project is here at all.

## History

R.E. DBObjects was started in 2012 as a project which helped me to learn about
[ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping) when I probably didn't even know what ORM was.
I used it mainly in R.E. Login, which became popular mainly among other beginners, and people still find me from time
to time to ask me if I would ever continue the project.

I don't encourage anyone to use R.E. Login or R.E DBObjects today, but now, in 2022, 11 years after abandoning these
project, I decided to add some fixes to make it work in a container with older PHP versions as a demonstration
how Docker can help us, and then make it work with recent PHPs as well.

Other possible improvement could be and probably will be translating it to English.

## Recommended alternatives

This is only a hobby project, so if you are looking for a stable library to work with real ORM,
you can try [Doctrine](https://www.doctrine-project.org/).
It is also used by [Symfony](https://symfony.com/), which is a popular PHP Framework.
You can also try to search for similar tools on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/).
